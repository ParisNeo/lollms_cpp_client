To create the chat application using the `lollmsClient` library, you'll need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Clone the `lollmsClient` Library**

Clone the `lollmsClient` library from your GitHub repository. If you haven't already created a GitHub repository for it, you can create one following GitHub's guidelines.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms_cpp_client.git
cd lollmsClient
```

**Step 2: Build and Install the `lollmsClient` Library**

Inside the `lollmsClient` directory, build and install the library using CMake:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

This will build and install the `lollmsClient` library on your system.

**Step 3: Create the Chat Application**

Now, you can create your chat application. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Create a new directory for your chat application:

   ```bash
   mkdir chatApp
   cd chatApp
   ```

2. Create a CMakeLists.txt file in the chatApp directory to set up the build process for your application. Replace `chatApp` with the actual name of your application:

   ```cmake
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.12)
   project(chatApp)

   # Find the lollmsClientLib package
   find_package(LollmsClientLib REQUIRED)

   add_executable(chatApp main.cpp)

   # Link your application with the lollmsClientLib library
   target_link_libraries(chatApp PRIVATE LollmsClientLib)
   ```

3. Create your main.cpp file for the chat application. You can use the code provided earlier in this conversation as the content of main.cpp.

4. In the chatApp directory, create a build directory and compile your application:

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

**Step 4: Run the Chat Application**

After successfully building your chat application, you can run it from the build directory:

```bash
./chatApp
```

Now, you have a chat application that uses the `lollmsClient` library to connect to the Lollms server and accumulate the discussion history over time.
